- [Hotel Schwert](https://schwert-thun.net/wsp/en/) is a nice and reasonably priced hotel in town. It’s in walking distance to the train station, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Note that it's close to city center and there will be a late-night festival ongoing. See if you can get a room that faces away from the square if you'd like some peace and quiet.
- [The Lab Hotel](https://thelabhotel.ch/en/homepage/) is the cheapest option. It’s a bit further than the Krone and is a training school for Swiss hoteliers. Let us know if you plan on staying there!
    - Check-in is at 3pm, but they're happy to hold luggage upon your arrival!
- [The Bellevue](https://bellevue-au-lac.ch/en/) is our venue for Saturday. It’s a bus ride away and a little more isolated from downtown, but if you’re looking for convenience to the ceremony, this is it.
