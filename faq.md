### What should I wear?

The only event with a dress code is Saturday. 

Our theme is *"High Summer Semi-Formal"*. Think linen, open collars, sandals & midi dresses.

It's likely going to be hot, so please don't feel the need to wear a jacket or a tie.

If you want to take a dip in the lake make sure to bring your bathing suit and sunscreen!


### Can I bring a plus one?

If your plus one is expressly named on the invitation, we would love for them to come!

### Is the wedding outdoors?

Assuming the weather is good, apero and the ceremony will be outdoors. Dinner will be served inside the hotel.

### Can I bring a gift?

No. We feel very adamantly that your presence is the gift. We very deeply appreciate you spending money and vacation time to celebrate with us!


### I have another question

Just ask us! We'll update this section as we get more questions.
