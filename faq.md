### What should I wear?

The only event with a dress code is Saturday. 

Our theme is *"High Summer Semi-Formal"*. Think linen, open collars, sandals & midi dresses.

It's likely going to be hot, so don't feel the need to wear a jacket or a tie.

If you want to take a dip in the lake make sure to bring your bathing suit!


### Can I bring my kids?

If your children are expressly named on the invitation, we would love for them to come!

### Can I bring a plus one?

If your plus one is expressly named on the invitation, we would love for them to come!

### Is the wedding outdoors?

Assuming the weather is good, apero and the ceremony will be outdoors. Dinner will be served in the marquee. The grounds are pretty amazing, so expect to walk around outside.

### Can I bring a gift?

No. We feel very adamantly that your presence is the gift. We very much appreciate you spending money and vacation time to celebrate with us. We also do not want to bring gifts back to New York!
