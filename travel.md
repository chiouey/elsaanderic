You can fly into any major Swiss airport (ZRH, GVA, BSL) but we recommend Zurich because it is the closest to Thun.

If you're arriving from somewhere else in Europe, consider taking the train!

## At Zurich Airport
- Once you land you can get wi-fi by having the internet provider SMS a login to your phone. If you don’t have roaming service, you can use a VoIP like Google Voice or scan your boarding pass at an airport information stand.
- There are tourist SIM vendors that should run around 20 CHF for 10 days of unlimited data. These likely will not get you EU roaming if you’re planning to head elsewhere afterwards. You can also get an e-SIM from someplace like Digital Republic ([Switzerland only](https://digitalrepublic.ch/en/esim/)).
- In Zurich, head towards the Railway station from Arrivals. The train station and the airport are connected! You can purchase a ticket from Zurich Flughafen to Thun Bahnhof (train station) at a self-service machine, via the SBB Mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c&hl=en&gl=US)), or in-person at the SBB Travel Centre. Here's their [timetable search](https://www.sbb.ch/en) in case you're perusing this site when you've landed!
- If you are planning to spend more time in Switzerland, consider getting a [Travel Pass, Flex Pass, or Half Fare Card](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/buy.html) at the airport. Make sure you buy your travel pass before you take the train to Thun so that your trip to Thun is included. If you want help choosing, they're super helpful at the travel center and can help you pick the most economical option. Here are a couple things to factor into your calculus: if you’re staying at a hotel in Thun, you will receive a [free bus pass](https://www.thunersee.ch/en/info-service/guest-cards/panoramacard-thunersee#c26349) for the duration of your stay, and if you plan to hang out with us the week before, we will mostly be staying in the Bernese Oberland region to keep travel costs down. 

## In Thun
- Once you’ve arrived at Thun Bahnhof, you can walk, take a bus, or take a taxi to your final destination. Google Maps is spot on for directions. Taxi and bus stands are right outside of the train station. The Hotel Krone is a nine minute walk. Lab Hotel is a 17 minute walk (6 minutes via bus + walk combo). The Bellevue is a 12 minute bus + walk combo.
