We have events on Friday August 9th and Saturday August 10th in Thun. You are welcome to come to as much or as little as you like. We will also be around the week before if you want to hang out.

### Friday

*The Strandabad is a city-sponsored lakeside swimming area with a big pool and great mountain views (take the 1 bus from Thun train station to Thun, Strandabad; the 5 bus to Thun, Schulstrasse; or walk ~30 minutes.)*

- **1:30 - 6:30pm:** completely optional swimming and lounging. This is low key - come and go if and when you want! We'll be around the whole time, with a badminton set. There are showers as well if you want to shower before dinner. 
- **6:30 - 9pm:** dinner at the Strandabad restaurant. We'll have a burger (veggie burgers too!) and salad buffet and refreshing beverages to boot! Dress is casual, wear whatever you would like!
- **9pm - late:** (again, optional!) [Thunfest](https://www.thunfest.ch/) is Switzerland's largest annual town festival and kicks off on Friday with lots of live music and bites

### Saturday - Main Event

*Hotel Bellevue au Lac is a lakefront hotel in Hilterfingen (take the 21 bus from Thun train station to Hilterfingen, Kirche. It’s a ~15 minute ride and the bus leaves every 10 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. It's a bit too far to walk from Thun.)*
