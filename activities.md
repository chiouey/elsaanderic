### Where to eat
- The grocers in Thun all have fresh, cheap prepared foods like sandwiches, bakery items, and salads. Unless we're packing food from home, this is what we'll grab on our way to a hike
   - There's [a Coop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coop+Supermarkt+Thun+Bahnhof/@46.7550556,7.6280238,17z/data=!3m1!5s0x478fe623c69e7d11:0xf32105be4caec5bd!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e89745650d:0x84caa4e7b6017ef5!8m2!3d46.7546275!4d7.6301552!16s%2Fg%2F11bxg04q6t) inside the train station and will be one of the few places open on Sundays. In the spirit of cannibalistic capitalist competition, there's also [a Coop Pronto](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coop+Pronto+Shop+Thun+am+Bahnhof/@46.7550556,7.6280238,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x478fb2e8aa7ace5b:0x506385d28cba2719!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e8a7a114d7:0x20c1c5bd9f290c6e!8m2!3d46.7550556!4d7.6305987!16s%2Fg%2F1td0xct9) across the street from the train station in case the line inside is too long
   - In town, [the Bälliz Migros](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Migros-Supermarkt+-+Thun+-+B%C3%A4lliz/@46.7601061,7.6241355,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2ddf98174ef:0x68cf6fd603f4e023!8m2!3d46.7601061!4d7.6267104!16s%2Fg%2F11h1365sv) has a wider selection of groceries and also a great prepared food section

- [Buvette](https://www.buvetteamsee.ch/en) is a super cute outdoor breakfast/lunch/dinner spot along the lake. Great for an apéro or a meal and you can jump in the lake while you're at it
