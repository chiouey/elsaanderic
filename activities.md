### Where to eat
- The groceries in Thun all have fresh, cheap prepared foods like sandwiches, bakery items, and salads. Unless we're packing food from home, this is what we'll grab on our way to a hike
   - There's [a Coop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coop+Supermarkt+Thun+Bahnhof/@46.7550556,7.6280238,17z/data=!3m1!5s0x478fe623c69e7d11:0xf32105be4caec5bd!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e89745650d:0x84caa4e7b6017ef5!8m2!3d46.7546275!4d7.6301552!16s%2Fg%2F11bxg04q6t) inside the train station and will be one of the few places open on Sundays. In the spirit of cannibalistic capitalist competition, there's also [a Coop Pronto](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coop+Pronto+Shop+Thun+am+Bahnhof/@46.7550556,7.6280238,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x478fb2e8aa7ace5b:0x506385d28cba2719!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e8a7a114d7:0x20c1c5bd9f290c6e!8m2!3d46.7550556!4d7.6305987!16s%2Fg%2F1td0xct9) across the street from the train station in case the line inside is too long.
   - In town, [the Bälliz Migros](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Migros-Supermarkt+-+Thun+-+B%C3%A4lliz/@46.7601061,7.6241355,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2ddf98174ef:0x68cf6fd603f4e023!8m2!3d46.7601061!4d7.6267104!16s%2Fg%2F11h1365sv) has a wider selection of groceries and also a great prepared food section. 
   - [Bistro Promenade](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bistro+Promenade/@46.7540232,7.6341101,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2efe68a76bf:0x6213a54da3203e9a!8m2!3d46.7540232!4d7.636685!16s%2Fg%2F11cm39mx8z) is family favorite. The original proprietor has more or less retired but still wakes up early to sell croissants on Saturday mornings.
   - [Steinmann](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steinmann/@46.7584685,7.6250335,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e771271eb7:0x30dd3e1a3451dfc5!8m2!3d46.7584685!4d7.6276084!16s%2Fg%2F1tlzz2b0) is a great place for tea and coffee. Make sure to order crèmeschnitte!
   - There's a Saturday fresh market in the [Bälliz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/B%C3%A4lliz,+3600+Thun,+Switzerland/@46.7574719,7.629063,19.88z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e77283299f:0x6c5c5cdd125eb8cd!8m2!3d46.7588007!4d7.6278975!16s%2Fg%2F1v9l9pp8) with its Bio (organic) cousin in the [Rathausplatz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rathausplatz/@46.7595643,7.6285139,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478fb2e738596bd3:0x5c97b3e10608aa0d!8m2!3d46.7595643!4d7.6285139!16s%2Fg%2F11bzt4pmgr)
