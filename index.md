Our wedding will be on **Saturday August 10, 2024** in Thun, Switzerland.

We'll keep this website updated with details, and put photos up here afterwards!

Can't wait to see you there!


Thun is located in the German-speaking canton of Bern, where the Aare river flows out of the lake of Thun

The weather in August in Thun is generally lovely with an average high of 75F and average lows of 55F. Your weather app will likely be in the ballpark but you can get more tailored predictions, including most importantly, the temperature of the lake to plan your swims from [Aare Guru](https://aare.guru/#thun) (albeit in Swiss-German).
